Ruby on Rails challenge 1 - Dynamic programming  Dynamic programming: Given a matrix consisting of 0's and 1's, find the maximum size sub-matrix consisting of only 1's.  1) Unless you already know, learn what the terms matrix and sub-matrix mean. What is a maximum size sub-matrix? How can you calculate it on paper? Try out a few examples on paper with a small matrix.  2) How can you implement a matrix in Ruby? Don't use a class for this, yet. Try to express this using arrays, hashes, or enumerables, or all of them.  3) Try to give two ways to program the solution. Which of your solutions is faster? Which requires more memory? Explain your answers.  4) Write a review for at least one fellow student who has already solved the challenge.  And please give us feedback for this challenge via info@mooqita.org
